  localization files.

# Localization

Localization files are used to translate:

* The Umbraco backoffice user interface so that end users can use Umbraco in their native language. This is particularly important for content editors who do not speak English.
* The member identity errors in an Umbraco website enable end users to use Umbraco in the website language.

You can also:

* Override existing language files.
* Include translations for your own package. Read [Add translations for your packages](../../extending-cms/packages/language-files-for-packages.md) to see how to you can achieve this.
