A Property Editor is composed of two extensions. To form a full Property Editor you will need a:

* Property Editor Schema&#x20;
* Property Editor UI

## Property Editor UI

A Property Editor UI is utilizing a Property Editor Schema, and you can have multiple Property Editor UIs for one Schema.

This means you can find a Schema that solves your needs. You only need to build a Property Editor UI.
