# Getting Started

This section will guide you through the key steps necessary to get you started with Umbraco UI Builder.

Before beginning, make sure that you already have an Umbraco v10+ website configured, which is ready to install Umbraco UI Builder. If you are unsure how to setup a basic Umbraco install, you should review the [Getting Started](https://docs.umbraco.com/welcome/getting-started/managing-an-umbraco-project) documentation on the main Umbraco developer portal. Then you can proceed with this guide.

## System Requirements

At this time, the minimum requirements for using Umbraco UI Builder are as follows:

* **Umbraco 10.0+**

* **SQL Server Database** (SQLite is fine for testing, but not recommended for live deployments)

## Versioning

Umbraco UI Builder follows the same [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) as Umbraco CMS. You can find more information about this on the [Versioning and Release Cadence page](https://umbraco.com/products/knowledge-center/versioning-and-release-cadence/)
