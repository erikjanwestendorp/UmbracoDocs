# Angular

Since Umbraco 7, the Umbraco backoffice has been built using Angular. The implementation is made up of many directives and services.

Generally, you can find information about these via the [Backoffice UI API documentation](https://apidocs.umbraco.com/v9/ui). While this part of the documentation is auto-generated from the Umbraco source code, you can also find below some more in-depth description and examples for these directives and services.

## Directives

- [Layout selector](Directives/umbLayoutSelector/) (`<umbLayoutSelector />`)
- [Load indicator](Directives/umbLoadIndicator/) (`<umbLoadIndicator />`)
- [Property](Directives/umbProperty/) (`<umbProperty />`)

## Services

- [Editor service](Services/editorService/)
- [Events service](Services/eventsService/)
