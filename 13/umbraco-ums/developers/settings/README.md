# Settings

In this section, you can find information about configuring different parts of uMS.

## [**Goals Configuration**](setup-goals.md)

Users can set goals to track important actions or A/B test results. These goals help monitor performance and effectiveness.

You can also find an article on [setting up custom Goal Scoring](custom-goals-scoring.md).

## [**IP Filtering**](ip-filtering.md)

This allows users to filter out internal traffic or specific IP addresses from being a part of the analytics data, ensuring more accurate reporting. For example, you could filter out any traffic from your workplace IP.

## [**The Configuration file**](./#the-configuration-file)

While most configurations and settings will be visible in the Umbraco backoffice, they can only be changed in the `appSettings.json` configuration file. The Configuration file article provides an overview of the available settings.

## [**Permissions**](permissions.md)

Administrators can assign different permissions to control access to marketing and content apps, based on user roles or Document Types.

These settings allow users to manage and fine-tune their marketing efforts, ensuring data accuracy and access control.
