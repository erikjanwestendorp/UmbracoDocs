The default implemented algorithm is based and randomness. As soon as a visitor visits the website or the specific webpage with an A/B test it get randomly assigned a variant. That variant is stored alongside the visitors cookie and as long as the visitor does not delete its cookie the same A/B test variant is shown.

Because the algorithm is based on randomness the number of visitors are not exactly distributes amongst all visitors but slight difference can occur.

In this A/B test you see for example that the variant distribution is not a perfect 33,333% (what you could expect with three variants) but there are slight differences.

In a later sprint (or if you're really in need of this) we will implement other A/B test algorithms, such as round-robin, as well.
