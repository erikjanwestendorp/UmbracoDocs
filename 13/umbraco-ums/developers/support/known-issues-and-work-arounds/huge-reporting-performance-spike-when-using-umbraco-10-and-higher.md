We have done some tests internally and are aware where generating reports for analytics on Umbraco 8 it can take a long time in comparison to newer and more modern Umbraco such as Umbraco 10 that are way faster at working with data.

When running the tests we found that when we run the exact same version of uMarketingSuite and data against an Umbraco 10 site, it was up to **10 times faster** at processing the data needed for the analytical reports.

If its possible for you to upgrade to Umbraco 10 or a newer LTS (Long Term Support) version of Umbraco, then please do so, as you will get much better speed and performance improvements from uMarketingSuite along with your Umbraco site.
