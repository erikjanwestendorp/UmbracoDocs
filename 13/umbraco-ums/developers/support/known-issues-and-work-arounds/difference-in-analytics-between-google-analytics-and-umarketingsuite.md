**Behaviour:**

You will see a difference in statistics between Google Analytics and uMarketingSuite.

**Details:**

uMarketingSuite will collect pageviews unless Goolge Analytics / GTM is blocked or GA / GTM cookies are not accepted. So approx. 10% - 25% more pageviews in uMarketingSuite compared to GA should be considered as normal depending on the audience with the current available information.

**Solution:**

This is the intended behaviour.

In uMarketingSuite 1.13 the bot detection has been improved so if you are running uMarketingSuite version 1.12.x or lower we recommend to upgrade to the latest version or at least 1.13.1
