When installing the package 'Font Awesome Icon Finder 1.1.0' ([https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/font-awesome-icon-finder/](https://our.umbraco.com/packages/backoffice-extensions/font-awesome-icon-finder/)) this will break the date picker that we use for the Analytics tab.

This is due to an issue in 'Font Awesome Icon Finder'. Also the default Umbraco date picker is not working anymore when installing this package (regardless whether you've installed uMarketingSuite).

This issue is fixed in version 1.1.2 of Font Awesome Icon Finder, so please make sure to install that. More details can be found here: [https://github.com/RobbieLD/FontAwesomeIconFinder/issues/6](https://github.com/RobbieLD/FontAwesomeIconFinder/issues/6).
