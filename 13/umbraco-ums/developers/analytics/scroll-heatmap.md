Curious how visitors consume you content?

In the Heatmap feature the uMarketingSuite gives a visual representation of the average scroll depth from your visitors on a specific page. This feature is only (!) available within the Analytics Content App on a specific Umbraco page.

An advantage is that you do not need to integrate any 3rd party tools which will prevent additional load times and possible data ownership issues.

Please note that the heatmap is only collecting data if you've installed [the clientside script](/analytics/clientside-events-and-additional-javascript-files/) on your website!
