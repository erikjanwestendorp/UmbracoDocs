# Bridging library for Google Tag Manager

If you're using Google Tag Manager on your website you can collect all the events that you're already sending to Google Tag Manager in the uMarketingSuite as well. This is setup in the same way as [classic Google Analytics](/analytics/clientside-events-and-additional-javascript-files/bridging-library-for-google-analytics/).

To include the file you should add the following code just before the closing &lt;/body&gt;-tag of your HTML:

    <script src="~/Assets/uMarketingSuite/Scripts/uMarketingSuite.analytics.ga-bridge.js"></script>
