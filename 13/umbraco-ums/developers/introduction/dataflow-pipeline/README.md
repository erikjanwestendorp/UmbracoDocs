The uMarketingSuite package is all about data, data and more data. To take the most out of this data and do it in the most efficient way we have four different stages where the data goes to:

1. [Data collection](/the-umarketingsuite-broad-overview/dataflow-pipeline/data-collection/): This is where the visitordata is collected and stored for a moment in memory of the server.
2. [Data storage](/the-umarketingsuite-broad-overview/dataflow-pipeline/data-storage/): This is where the data from memory goes to a persistent storage (I mean a database :P)
3. [Data processing](/the-umarketingsuite-broad-overview/dataflow-pipeline/data-parsing/): The data is processed at a later moment to make it more efficient and normalized
4. [Data reporting](/the-umarketingsuite-broad-overview/dataflow-pipeline/reporting/): And finally the data is reported within the uMarketingSuite

The concept of this dataflow is the most important concept to grasp when using the uMarketingSuite. Please see the video about how it works.
