# How it works

When visitors are accepting the uMarketingSuite cookie on the website, it allows uMarketingSuite to collect and store data about their browsing behavior, preferences, and interactions. This data can include things like pages visited, time spent on each page, actions taken on the site, and more. This data can't be shared with 3rd parties because the data is stored in the local database of the site.

With this information, uMarketingSuite can use this collected information to:

- Show Analytics
- Run A/B tests
- Personalize content
- Build local user profiles

When visitors do not accept the uMarketingSuite cookie, the website's ability to collect and store this data is limited. As a result:

- Basic Analytics
- No A/B testing
- No Personalization
- No Profiling

To comply with privacy regulations like GDPR or CCPA, websites often give users the option to accept or reject cookies, [read more here how to accomplish this](/the-umarketingsuite-broad-overview/the-umarketingsuite-cookie/module-permissions/). This choice impacts the kind and depth of data collected and consequently affects the statistical analysis and personalization capabilities for those visitors.
