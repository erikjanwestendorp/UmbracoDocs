# Anonymization

For short term Analytics it would be important who clicked on what link at what time and with what browser. This is relevant as you would want to [personalize](/personalization/) the website or webpage based on that behavior. In the long term, however, this is no longer important. Aggregated and anonymized data will still be needed for something like comparing the number of visitors month after month.

uMS gives you the ability to anonymize your data. By anonymizing the data the data is unlinked from the specific session and visitor, but the data remains stored.

Let us take a look at an example:

*Before* anonymization you can see that visitor X has visited your website four times. On the first visit the visitor visited webpage w1 and w2, scrolled down on both of them to 80% of the page length. That visit was on a iPhone with Safari. Three days later the visitor came back and saw webpage w1 again and made a purchase on w3. This visit was with Firefox on a Windows computer.

*After* anonymization you can not relate the individual visits of the webpages or the browser to visitor X any longer. But if you go to the Analytics reports of visits, browsers and scrolldepths you still see the exact same number as before the anonymization.

It is recommended to anonymize your data after two years or sooner.
