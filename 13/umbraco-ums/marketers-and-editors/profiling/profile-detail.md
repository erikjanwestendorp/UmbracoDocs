# Profile Detail

In the Profiles section, you can access specific visitor profiles, which contain two sections: **Insights** and **Activity**.

## Insights

The insights section provides an overview of the visitor.

![]()

Here, you can see:

- The date of the visitor's first session on the website,
- The date of the visitor's last activity,
- The number of sessions,
- The number of pageviews,
- The time spent on the website, and
- The total engaged time.

You can also view any goals triggered by this visitor.

### Profile Potential

![]()

The uMarketingSuite will also show the potential of the profile based on the engagement time and when the profile was last active.

By default, a profile is considered active if the profile has visited the website in the last 30 days.

By default, a profile is considered engaged when the engagement time of the visitor was higher than 300 seconds in the last 3 sessions.

The exact settings (30 days, 300 seconds, 3 sessions) can be overwritten via the [uMarketingSuite configuration file](/installing-umarketingsuite/configuration-options-1-x/).

## Calculated Persona & Customer Journey Phase

Within the profile, you can see all [personas](/personalization/implicit-explicit-personalization/setting-up-personas/) and [customer journeys](/personalization/implicit-explicit-personalization/setting-up-the-customer-journey/) that you have setup within the uMarketingSuite. Each persona and customer journey phase displays a score. You can see if uMarketingSuite has assigned a persona or journey phase to this visitor. In the below example, you see that the uMarketingSuite has assigned the persona "Data & Privacy officer" to this visitor.
