If you go to a specific profile in the Profiles section you get access to two sections in that profiles "Insights" & "Activity"

## Insights

The insights section shows you an overview of the visitor

![]()

You see when the visitor first visited the website (first session), when the visitor has been to the website for the last time (Last activity), the number of sessions, the number of pageviews, the time spent on the website and the total engaged time.

You also see if there any goals triggered by this visitor.

### Profile potential

![]()

The uMarketingSuite will also show the potential of the profile based on the engagement time and when the profile was last active.

By default a profile is considered active if the profile has visited the website in the last 30 days. 

By default a profile is considered engaged when the engagement time of the visitor was higher than 300 seconds in the last 3 sessions.

The exact settings (30 days, 300 seconds, 3 sessions) can be overwritten via the [uMarketingSuite configuration file](/installing-umarketingsuite/configuration-options-1-x/).

## Calculated persona & customer journey phase

On the profile we will also see all [personas](/personalization/implicit-explicit-personalization/setting-up-personas/) and [customer journeys](/personalization/implicit-explicit-personalization/setting-up-the-customer-journey/) that you have setup within the uMarketingSuite. Per persona and customer journey phase the score is shown and we will show if they uMarketingSuite assigns a persona or customer journey phase to this visitor. In the below example you see that the uMarketingSuite has assigned the persona "Data & Privacy officer" to this visitor.
