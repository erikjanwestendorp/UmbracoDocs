# Front end Rendering

The A/B Test will automatically be rendered in your front end. If you have set up a [Single page A/B test](../../../../a-b-testing/types-of-a-b-tests/single-page-a-b-test/) uMS and Umbraco will automatically render the correct properties.

If you have set up one of the other tests and added some CSS and JavaScript this will automatically be added to your webpage.

You do not have to do anything to render the A/B test. If you want to run a more advanced A/B test that requires more coding, you can always do that. [Our reference documentation](../../../../a-b-testing/reference/) gives you an overview of all functions that we provide for you to create an advanced A/B test.
