# Front end rendering

The A/B Test will automatically be rendered in your frontend. If you've setup a "[Single page A/B test](/a-b-testing/types-of-a-b-tests/single-page-a-b-test/)" the uMarketingSuite together with Umbraco will automatically render the correct properties.

If you've setup of one of the other tests and added some CSS and JavaScript to your A/B Test we will automatically this JavaScript and CSS to your webpage.

You do not have to do anything to render the A/B test. If want to run a more advanced A/B test that requires some coding as well, you can always do that. [Our reference](/a-b-testing/reference/) gives you an overview of all functions that we provide to you to create an advanced A/B test!
