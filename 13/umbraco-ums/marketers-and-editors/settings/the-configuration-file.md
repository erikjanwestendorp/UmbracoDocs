# The Configuration File

In this setting you have an overview of all configured settings of the uMarketingSuite. It's not possible to change the configuration options directly. This should be done via the configuration file on disk. We have also [documented the complete configuration file](/installing-umarketingsuite/configuration-options-1-x/).
