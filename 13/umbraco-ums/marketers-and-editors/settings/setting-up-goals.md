Goals are important in the uMarketingSuite. Without goals you cannot see whether your optimization strategy via [A/B Testing](/a-b-testing/) or [Personalization](/personalization/) really works.

Via the uMarketingSuite [you can setup your goals](/installing-umarketingsuite/settings-section/setup-goals/), but if you want your goal scoring to the next level you can always implement your [own custom goals](/analytics/setting-up-goals/custom-goals-scoring/)!
