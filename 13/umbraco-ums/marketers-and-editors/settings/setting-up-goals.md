# Setting Up Goals

Goals are important in the uMarketingSuite. Without goals you cannot determine whether your optimization strategy through [A/B Testing](../ab-testing/README.md) or [Personalization](../personalization/README.md) really works.

[You can setup your goals](setup-goals.md) through the uMarketingSuite Settings section. If you want an advanced goal scoring, consider implementing your [own custom goals](../../developers/settings/custom-goals-scoring.md).
