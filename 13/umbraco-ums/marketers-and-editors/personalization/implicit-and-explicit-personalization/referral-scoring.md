# Referral Scoring

In this section we explain how you can create **Referral groups** and score referrers in these groups.

First create a **Referral group**:

![]()

and assign a score to your **Personas** and/or **Journey's**.

![]()

Save your **Referral group**

Go to the **Unscored referral** tab and assign a referrer to your newly created group.

![]()

By default the score will be assigned when the referrer matches the whole URL (**i.e. facebook.com/mycompany/products**). It is also possible to assign the score on the entire domain (**i.e. facebook.com**). Tick the '**Score on domain only**' checkbox.

![]()

You are all set!
