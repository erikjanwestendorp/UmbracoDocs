# Referral Scoring



1. create a **Referral group**:

![]()

2. Assign a score to your **Personas** and/or **Journey**.

![]()

3. Save your **Referral Group**
4. Go to the **Unscored referral** tab&#x20;
5. Assign a referrer to your newly created group.

![]()

By default the score will be assigned when the referrer matches the whole URL (in this case **facebook.com/mycompany/products**). It is also possible to assign the score on the entire domain (That is **facebook.com**).&#x20;

6. Tick the '**Score on domain only**' checkbox.

![]()

You have now created Referral groups and score referrers in your groups.
