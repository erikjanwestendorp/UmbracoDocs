# Setting up the Customer Journey

To setup implicit personalization within the uMarketingSuite you can setup a specific customer journey for your website. This can be done by going to the Marketing section in your Umbraco installation and to the subsection "**Personalization**". There you can navigate to the tab "**Journeys**".

Setting up the customer journey works the same as [setting up personas](/personalization/implicit-explicit-personalization/setting-up-personas/).

The biggest difference with personas is that there is a specific order of customer journey steps within a customer journey. That is also why it's possible to add new customer journey steps between existing steps, or reorder steps by drag-and-dropping steps in the correct order.

When you install the uMarketingSuite we add one customer journey already which is based on the Google customer journey with the steps **See, Think, Do & Care**.
