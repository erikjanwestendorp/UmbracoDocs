# Setting up the customer journey

This can be done by going to the Marketing section in your Umbraco installation and the sub-section "**Personalization**". There you can navigate to the tab "**Journeys**".

Setting up the customer journey works the same as [setting up personas](setting-up-personas.md).

The biggest difference with personas is that there is a specific order of customer journey steps within a customer journey. It is possible to add new customer journey steps between existing steps. You can also reorder the steps by dragging and dropping them in the correct order.

When installing Umbraco uMS we add one customer journey based on the Google customer journey with the steps **See, Think, Do and Care**.
