As soon as you have setup a persona and a customer journey step in the uMarketingSuite you can start scoring the content of your website. Each Umbraco node can be scored against personas and the customer journey.

To do this simply navigate to a node in Umbraco and open the content app "**Personalization**" on that node:

![]()

If you go to that content app you can navigate to the tab "**Content scoring**" to score this Umbraco page. If you've written your content for a specific set of personas you can assign a score that will be added to this persona or customer journey step.

Simply setup the score and save the scoring. In the following example the persona "**Data & Privacy officer**" will get **10 points** and the "**Marketer**" will get **5 points** when they read this Umbraco node.
