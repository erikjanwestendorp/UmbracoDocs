Within the Analytics section the uMarketingSuite shows all collected data. This data is collected by serverside and clientside tracking data.

In this section we document which data we collect, how we classify different clients visiting your website, and also how to extend the data collection with your own data!

The Analytics section of the uMarketingSuite can be found in the Marketing section and as a content app on every node.
