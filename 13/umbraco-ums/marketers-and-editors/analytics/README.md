# Analytics

In the **Analytics** section, the uMarketingSuite displays all the collected data. This data is gathered through both server-side and client-side tracking.

In this section, you will find:

* Which data is collected
* How different clients visiting your website are classified
* How you can extend the data collection with your own custom data

The **Analytics** section is accessible from the **Marketing** section and as a content app on each node.
