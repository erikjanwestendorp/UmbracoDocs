# Difference between Google Analytics and uMS

**Behaviour:**

You will see a difference in statistics between Google Analytics and uMarketingSuite.

**Details:**

Umbraco uMS will collect pageviews unless Google Analytics / GTM is blocked or GA / GTM cookies are not accepted. So approx. 10% - 25% more pageviews in Umbraco uMS compared to GA should be considered as normal depending on the audience with the current available information.
