# The uMS Section

When you install the uMarketingSuite, a new section called **Marketing** is automatically enabled  in the Umbraco backoffice.

If you do not see the Marketing section, it is likely that you have not been granted access to it. You can set up access in the **Users** section of Umbraco. If the Marketing or Users section is not visible, ask your administrator for assistance.

## The Marketing Section

In the Marketing section, you will find several subsections, each providing insights into a specific feature of the uMarketingSuite.

Currently, not all sections are enabled, but they will be activated as the uMarketingSuite evolves. Stay updated by keeping an eye on [the roadmap](https://www.umarketingsuite.com/roadmap/) for new features.

Currently, the available sections are:

* [Analytics](../analytics/): The most important feature of the uMarketingSuite where all data is collected.
* [A/B Testing](../ab-testing/): Set up new projects and start A/B testing directly.
* [Settings](../settings/): View and configure various global settings used throughout the uMarketingSuite.

## The Dashboard

On the dashboard, you can view the current version of the uMarketingSuite installed and see how the license is configured.

It also provides links to [tutorial videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJWoJ-rKhx8uIs\_zmMS84yA/videos) and the [roadmap of the uMarketingSuite](https://www.umarketingsuite.com/roadmap).
