Or if you are using a Umbraco 9+ that runs on .NET you can open a terminal window and install the Nuget package with the following command, making sure you have navigated to the folder containing the Umbraco website you wish to install uMarketingSuite into.

```

### It really is simple as that ðŸŽ‰

_If you have any trouble, please go to_ [_Troubleshooting installs_](../../../installing-umarketingsuite/troubleshooting-installs/)_._

## Next steps...

![]()\
If you've installed the uMarketingSuite you can build or restart your website and automatically the **Marketing** section will appear in the backoffice, as shown above.

The next step is to [configure a license](../../../installing-umarketingsuite/licensing/) and you're ready to go, but to get the best out of uMarkerktingSuite make sure to follow these additional steps.

### Umbraco Forms

If you've installed **Umbraco Forms** as well and want to automatically track submissions of Umbraco Forms. Please install the package [uMarketingSuite.UmbracoForms](https://www.nuget.org/packages/uMarketingSuite.UmbracoForms) via NuGet as well using your preferred approach as above.

```
PM> install package uMarketingSuite.UmbracoForms
```

For modern Umbraco 9+ use

```
dotnet add package uMarketingSuite.UmbracoForms
```

### Clientside tracking

To capture events that happen on the clientside (frontend) of your website, you will need to add the [clientside tracking script](../../../analytics/clientside-events-and-additional-javascript-files/additional-measurements-with-our-ums-analytics-scripts/) by including this snippet on all of your pages.

```
<script src="/Assets/uMarketingSuite/Scripts/uMarketingSuite.analytics.js"></script>
```

### Cockpit

Cockpit is a tool to help with testing segments and diagnose the data uMarkertingSuite is collecting and can be viewed on the frontend of your website, only if you are logged into Umbraco as well.\
Install cockpit on your website by adding the following Razor Partial View in your templates in Umbraco just before the closing \</body> tag

Learn more [what Cockpit is and how you can use](../../../installing-umarketingsuite/cockpit/) it.

```
@Html.Partial("uMarketingSuite/Cockpit")</body>
```

### Optional Extras

Here are some optional extras you can do to improve your experience with uMarketingSuite.

1.  Add a [Google Analytics bridging script](../../../analytics/clientside-events-and-additional-javascript-files/bridging-library-for-google-analytics/) that automatically sends events that you send to Google Analytics, to uMarketingSuite as well.

    ```
     <script src="~/Assets/uMarketingSuite/Scripts/uMarketingSuite.analytics.ga4-bridge.min.js"></script>
    ```
2.  Optionally, add the [Google Analytics blocker detection script](../../../analytics/clientside-events-and-additional-javascript-files/google-analytics-blocker-detection/) as well. This gives you insights in which page traffic the uMarketingSuite will track, and Google Analytics won't track!

    ```
     <script src="/Assets/uMarketingSuite/Scripts/uMarketingSuite.analytics.blockerdetection.js"></script>
    ```

## That's it! Now you're ready to start! ðŸš€
