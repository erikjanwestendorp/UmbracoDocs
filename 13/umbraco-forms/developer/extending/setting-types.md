# Setting Types

Umbraco Forms field, prevalue source and workflow types are defined in C# and include one or more setting values.

These settings are completed by the editor when using the type on their form.

Each setting type can have it's own user interface. So a string can use a text box but a more complicated JSON structure can use a more appropriate user interface.

The user interface used for a particular setting is defined by the `View` property:

```csharp
[Umbraco.Forms.Core.Attributes.Setting("Message", View = "TextField")]
public string Message { get; set; }
```

## Built-in setting types

All of the above setting types are used in one or more field, prevalue source and workflow types available with Umbraco Forms. For the less common ones, a usage has been indicated in the table.

The two exceptions are "TextWithFieldPicker" and "MultipleTextString". We do not use these two within the package, but we make them available for developers to use when creating their own types.

"TextWithFieldPicker" offers the option of text field entry or selection of a field from the form. This can be useful in workflows where you need to reference the value of a specific field.

"MultipleTextString" offers the option of creating multiple text field entries. This can be useful in workflows where you need to provide multiple text values.

## Creating a setting type

To create a custom setting type you will need an AngularJS view and controller in the following location: `/App_Plugins/MyPlugin/`.

{% hint style="info" %}
Your plugin folder path must be outside of the `/App_Plugins/UmbracoForms/` folder if you use a custom Angular controller and Package.manifest.
{% endhint %}

You then add the name of the view as the `View` property on the `Setting` attribute defined on the type.
