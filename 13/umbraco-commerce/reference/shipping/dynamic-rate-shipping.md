# Dynamic Rate Shipping

Dynamic rate shipping in Umbraco Commerce allows you to define a series of ranges from which an order will be checked against. These checks find which range a given order falls within which in turn identifies the rates that apply. For each range, a series of rate options can be configured. Examples include a fixed rate per order, a fixed rate per order item, or percentage-based rates. By combining these configurable ranges, and different rating options it allows you to create a more dynamic algorithm than the basic fixed-rate shipping option.
