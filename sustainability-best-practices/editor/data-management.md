# Data Management

## Only Collect the necessary data

* Action: Review forms and only ask for essential information.
* Why: Less data means less storage and energy use, plus it's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)-friendly.

## Clean Up Inactive Members and Mailing Lists

* Action: Regularly remove users who haven't logged in for 365 days and prune mailing lists based on engagement.
* Why: It improves email deliverability and reduces storage needs.
