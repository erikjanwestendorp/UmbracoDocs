### Media and Content Cleanup
* Action: Use analytics to identify and remove unused media and low-traffic content.
* Why: Keeps the site lightweight and efficient.

### Discourage Printing
* Action: Add a note at the bottom of pages and PDFs, "Think before you print. Save trees, keep it digital."
* Why: It encourages users to think twice before using paper.
