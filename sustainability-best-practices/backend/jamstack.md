# JAMstack

The adoption of [JAMstack architecture](https://jamstack.org/), Static Site Generation (SSG), and Content Delivery Network (CDN) distribution stands as a commendable choice for sustainable system design. JAMstack's decoupled approach separates the frontend from the backend, allowing for efficient resource allocation and reduced server-side processing. When combined with Static Site Generation (SSG), which pre-generates static content at build time, this results in decreased server load and faster loading times. 

CDN distribution further amplifies these benefits by delivering content from geographically distributed edge servers, minimizing data transfer distances and latency. This holistic approach not only optimizes user experiences but also reduces energy consumption by minimizing server processing needs and data transmission over long distances. 

By prioritizing resource efficiency and performance, JAMstack, Static Site Generation (SSG), and Content Delivery Network (CDN) distribution align seamlessly with sustainable design principles. They creating web systems that operate in an ecologically responsible manner while delivering exceptional user experiences.
