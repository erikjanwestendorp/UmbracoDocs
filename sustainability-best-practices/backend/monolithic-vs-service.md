  When assessing the sustainability of architectural choices, the distinction
  between monolithic and service-based architectures takes center stage.

# Monolithic vs. Service based Architecture

**Monolithic architectures** encompass tightly integrated components within a single application, whereas **service-based architectures**, like microservices, emphasize modular, loosely coupled services.

From a sustainable development perspective, **service-based architectures** hold a clear advantage. By allowing services to scale independently, microservices ensure efficient resource utilization. This agility translates into reduced energy consumption and optimal performance, as resources are allocated precisely where needed.

**Monolithic architectures** often suffer from overprovisioning, which can lead to unnecessary resource usage and increased carbon footprint.&#x20;

In contrast, the ability of microservices to scale only the necessary components contributes to a more ecologically conscious approach.&#x20;

The service-based paradigm aligns closely with the principles of sustainable development. It does this by facilitating leaner resource consumption, promoting efficient scaling, and ultimately fostering a software ecosystem that operates in harmony with environmental preservation.
