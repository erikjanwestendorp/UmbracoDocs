# Async calls / fire and forget

Utilizing asynchronous calls, often referred to as "fire and forget", presents substantial benefits from the perspective of sustainable systems design. By employing this approach, tasks are dispatched for execution without necessitating immediate waiting for their completion. This mechanism enhances system efficiency and responsiveness. It does it because it enables the system to continue processing other tasks while awaiting the completion of the asynchronous task. 

This strategy aligns closely with the principles of sustainable design by optimizing resource utilization. Rather than idling or blocking resources, the system can allocate them to other tasks, minimizing wastage and conserving energy. This proves especially advantageous in scenarios where processing times might vary or when tasks don't require immediate feedback. 

Asynchronous calls not only enhance overall system performance. They also contribute to a more ecologically conscious software ecosystem, where resource efficiency is a cornerstone of sustainable systems design.
