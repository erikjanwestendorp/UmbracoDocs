# Apply upgrades and patches

Implementing upgrades and patches, such as migrating to Umbraco 10+, is highly advantageous from the standpoint of sustainable system design. Staying up-to-date with the latest software versions ensures that the system benefits from enhanced performance, security, and efficiency. 

Regular updates often include optimizations that reduce resource consumption and streamline processes, aligning with the principles of sustainable design by maximizing resource efficiency. Additionally, newer versions typically integrate eco-friendly features and improved coding practices, contributing to reduced energy consumption and minimized environmental impact. 

By proactively embracing upgrades and patches, organizations not only secure their systems against vulnerabilities. They also foster a more resilient, energy-efficient, and ecologically conscious technology landscape, which ultimately supports the long-term sustainability of their operations.
