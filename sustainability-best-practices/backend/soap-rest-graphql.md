# SOAP, REST and GraphQL

Viewing APIs through the lens of sustainable development reveals crucial considerations for optimizing their efficiency. In modern cloud applications, where asynchronous transactions between services are prevalent, the format used for encoding payload data becomes pivotal. Evaluating the necessity of communication volume and reducing unnecessary chatter emerges as a priority. This perspective aligns well with the principles of the Green Software Foundation, particularly energy efficiency. By taking proactive steps, applications can operate in a more resource-conscious manner.

An effective approach encompasses multiple recommendations. Understanding the implications of the chatty I/O antipattern is essential to grasp how excessive requests impact performance. To enhance reliability and reduce undue stress on systems, implementing advanced request throttling via API Management is crucial. Additionally, optimizing the data returned from requests by selective encoding and utilizing message encoding considerations helps minimize unnecessary load. Employing response caching minimizes redundant processing of identical data from the backend, further aligning with the goal of resource efficiency.

The concept of sustainable development in application design, as highlighted by [Microsoft's Azure Well-Architected framework](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/well-architected/sustainability/sustainability-application-design), underscores the importance of these practices. It emphasizes the creation of systems that not only fulfill their intended function but also do so with minimal ecological impact.

In addition, comparing Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP), REST (REpresentational State Transfer), and GraphQL APIs accentuates the advantages of GraphQL. Particularly in terms of reducing HTTP requests and optimizing data aggregation. GraphQL's ability to request precisely the needed data for a specific function minimizes unnecessary data transfer, contributing to an ecologically conscious approach. This streamlined querying aligns with the principles of sustainable development, demonstrating a commitment to resource efficiency and optimal system performance.
