# Overview

These topics help you to enhance System Sustainability through different practices:

## Async

Utilizing asynchronous calls, often referred to as "fire and forget", presents substantial benefits from the perspective of sustainable systems design.

## Background Tasks

Implementing background tasks or batching up requests to run in sustainable cloud regions and during off-peak hours of power consumption.

## Cache Responses

Caching in backend development plays a pivotal role in sustainable system design reducing the need for repeated processing and resource-intensive database queries.

## Common Pitfalls

Conducting thorough performance testing and optimization of backend services holds great merit from the standpoint of sustainable system design.

## Jam Stack

The adoption of JAMstack architecture, Static Site Generation (SSG), and Content Delivery Network (CDN) distribution stands as a commendable choice for sustainable system design.

## Monolithic vs. Service

When assessing the sustainability of architectural choices, the distinction between monolithic and service-based architectures takes center stage.

## Performance testing

Conducting thorough performance testing and optimization of backend services holds great merit from the standpoint of sustainable system design.

## Soap Rest and GraphQL

Viewing APIs through the lens of sustainable development reveals crucial considerations for optimizing their efficiency.

## SQL Optimization

Efficient SQL optimization, particularly in the precise utilization of joins, carries significance within the framework of sustainable system design.

## Sustainable Design Patterns

Learn about how you can optimize assets, implement a mobile-first strategy and other suggestions.

## Upgrades and Patches

Staying up-to-date with the latest software versions ensures that the system benefits from enhanced performance, security, and efficiency.
