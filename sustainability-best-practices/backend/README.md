# Backend Overview

These topics help you to enhance System Sustainability through different practices:

## [Async](async.md)

Utilizing asynchronous calls, often referred to as "fire and forget", presents substantial benefits from the perspective of sustainable systems design.

## [Background Tasks](background-tasks.md)

Implementing background tasks or batching up requests to run in sustainable cloud regions and during off-peak hours of power consumption.

## [Cache Responses](cache-responses.md)

Caching in backend development plays a pivotal role in sustainable system design reducing the need for repeated processing and resource-intensive database queries.

## [Common Pitfalls](common-pitfalls.md)

Conducting thorough performance testing and optimization of backend services holds great merit from the standpoint of sustainable system design.

## [Jam Stack](jamstack.md)

The adoption of JAMstack architecture, Static Site Generation (SSG), and Content Delivery Network (CDN) distribution stands as a commendable choice for sustainable system design.

## [Monolithic vs. Service](monolithic-vs-service.md)

When assessing the sustainability of architectural choices, the distinction between monolithic and service-based architectures takes center stage.

## [Performance testing](performance-testing.md)

Conducting thorough performance testing and optimization of backend services holds great merit from the standpoint of sustainable system design.

## [Soap Rest and GraphQL](soap-rest-graphql.md)

Viewing APIs through the lens of sustainable development reveals crucial considerations for optimizing their efficiency.

## [SQL Optimization](sql-optimization.md)

Efficient SQL optimization, particularly in the precise utilization of joins, carries significance within the framework of sustainable system design.

## [Sustainable Design Patterns](sustainable-design-patterns.md)

Learn about how you can optimize assets, implement a mobile-first strategy and other suggestions.

## [Upgrades and Patches](upgrades-and-patches.md)

Staying up-to-date with the latest software versions ensures that the system benefits from enhanced performance, security, and efficiency.
