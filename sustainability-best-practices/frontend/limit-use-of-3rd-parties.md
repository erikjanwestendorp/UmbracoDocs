# Limit the use of 3rd parties

Third-party requests account for [45% of all requests](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/sustainability#third-parties), with 94% of mobile websites having at least one identifiable third-party resource.

Whilst 3rd parties can enhance the functionality of your website, they will introduce more HTTP requests. Potentially this will add other undesirable outcomes for the user such as sharing data. Consider the purpose of each 3rd party before introducing and check that these are not adding too much to the page weight. Itâ€™s also possible that these 3rd parties are not using green hosting providers.
