# Limit the use of 3rd Parties

Third-party requests account for [45% of all requests](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/sustainability#third-parties), with 94% of mobile websites having at least one identifiable third-party resource.

While third parties can enhance the functionality of your website, they will introduce more HTTP requests. Potentially this will add other undesirable outcomes for the user such as sharing data. Before adding any third party, assess their purpose and ensure they don't increase the page weight. Itâ€™s also possible that these 3rd parties are not using [green hosting providers](../infrastructure/hosting.md#hosting-renewable-and-low-carbon-energy).
