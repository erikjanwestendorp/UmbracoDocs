# Sustainable design, mobile first

When it comes to design, we should be making sustainable choices from the outset. Consider the use of images and large graphics that could contribute to page weight. If possible, remove the use of stock images which provide little to no value.

Choose more efficient colours and provide a [dark mode](https://www.purdue.edu/newsroom/releases/2021/Q3/dark-mode-may-not-save-your-phones-battery-life-as-much-as-you-think,-but-there-are-a-few-silver-linings.html) by default, which could reduce the energy usage even further. Switching from light mode to dark mode at 100% brightness can save an average of 39%-47% battery power. Dark mode support has [existed on the web since 2019](https://caniuse.com/prefers-color-scheme) and should be taken into account.

Start with mobile first and scale up if necessary, introducing design tweaks at bigger viewports. https://www.lowww.directory/ provides some examples of this.

Introduce energy-saving toggles to adapt the design and turn on a low carbon version of the website when the grid is at higher intensity. By highlighting these options to the user, we can inform them and help them to make more sustainable choices. [Boohoo](https://boohoo.co.uk) and [Herning.dk](https://herning.dk) have both introduced this recently. There are tools such as the [Carbon Intensity API](https://www.carbonintensity.org.uk) and the [Carbon Aware Software Development Kit (SDK)](https://github.com/Green-Software-Foundation/carbon-aware-sdk). Tools that will allow you to pull information about the intensity of the grid in your location.
