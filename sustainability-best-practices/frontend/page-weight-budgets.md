# Page Weight Budget

Page weight represents the amount of data transferred to access the web page (based only on HTTP requests). In short, the bigger the number, the more carbon emissions.

It is recommended to keep this metric as low as possible so setting a page weight budget can help you stay on top of this. As mentioned in the [Web Almanac](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/sustainability#page-weight), 1 MB should be a maximum when you get started, with 500 kB as the ultimate threshold.
