# Page weight budget

Page weight represents the amount of data transferred to access the web page (based only on HTTP requests). Shortly defined, the bigger the number, the more carbon emissions.

It is recommended to keep this metric as low as possible so setting a page weight budget can help you keep on top of this. As denoted in the [Web Almanac](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2022/sustainability#page-weight), 1 MB should be a maximum when you get started but 500 kB should be your ultimate threshold.
