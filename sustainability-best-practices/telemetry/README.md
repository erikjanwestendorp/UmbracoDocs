# About Telemetry

The Telemetry Data dashboard is a consent screen that is used for collecting system and usage information from your installation. Here, you can see what type of data is being collected and even adjust the level of reporting. Currently, there are three levels available: Minimal, Basic, and Detailed. You can read more about this in the [Settings Dashboard ](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cms/fundamentals/backoffice/settings-dashboards#telemetry-data) article.

Here you can find articles summing up the insights we've got through the detailed telemetry we've collected.
