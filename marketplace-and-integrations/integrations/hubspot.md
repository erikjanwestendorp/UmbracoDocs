# Hubspot

This integration provides a form picker and rendering component for forms managed within a [Hubspot](https://www.hubspot.com/) account.

## Package Links

- [NuGet install](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.Crm.Hubspot)
- [Source code](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Cms.Integrations/tree/main/src/Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.Crm.Hubspot)
- [Umbraco marketplace listing](https://marketplace.umbraco.com/package/umbraco.cms.integrations.crm.hubspot)

## Prerequisites

Required minimum versions of Umbraco CMS:

- Version 8: 8.5.4
- Version 10: 10.0.0
- Version 11: 11.0.0

## Authentication

The package uses the OAuth protocol for authentication or private access tokens if you are using a private app installed on your HubSpot account.

## Additional Configuration

To support multi-region HubSpot forms, the following configuration is required:

For Umbraco 8, in `web.config`:

```xml
  <appSettings>
    <add key="Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.Crm.Hubspot.ApiKey" value="[your_private_app_access_token]" />
    <add key="Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.Crm.Hubspot.Region" value="[region]" />
  </appSettings>
```

For Umbraco 10+, in `appsettings.json`:

```json
  "Umbraco": {
    "Integrations": {
      "Crm": {
        "Dynamics": {
          "Settings": {
            "ApiKey": "[your_private_app_access_token]",
            "Region": "[region]"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
```

For example, in Europe, a setting of `eu1` should be used.

## Backoffice usage

To use the form picker, a new Data Type should be created based on the HubSpot Form Picker property editor.

The settings will be checked and a message presented indicating whether authentication is in place.

If OAuth is being used for authentication the _Connect_ button will be enabled. When clicked, you will be prompted by the HubSpot authorization window.

The retrieved access token will be saved into the database and used for future requests.

The _Revoke_ action will remove the access token from the database and the authorization process will need to be repeated.

If a private access token is used a message will be displayed notifying that access token is being used.

## Front-end rendering

A strongly typed model will be generated by the property value converter. An HTML helper is available, to render the form on the front-end.

Ensure your template has a reference to the following using statement:

```csharp
@using Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.Crm.Hubspot.Helpers;
```

Assuming a property based on the created Data Type, with alias `hubSpotForm` has been created, render the form using:

```csharp
@Html.RenderHubspotForm(Model.HubspotForm)
```
