## Minimum version requirements

### Umbraco CMS

| Major      | Minor/Patch |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Version 10 | 10.0.1      |
| Version 11 | 11.0.0      |

## Authentication

All requests to the ActiveCampaign API are authenticated by providing an API key. The API key is included as an HTTP header called _Api\_Token_.

If the configuration is incomplete, the user will receive an error message.

## Configuration

To connect to your ActiveCampaign account, the following configuration is required:

{% code title="appsettings.json" %}
```json
"Umbraco": {
  "CMS": {
    "Integrations": {
        "Crm": {
          "ActiveCampaign": {
            "Settings": {
              "BaseUrl": "https://[YOUR_ACCOUNT_NAME].api-us1.com",
              "ApiKey": "[YOUR_API_KEY]"
            }
          }
        }
      }
```
{% endcode %}

## Backoffice usage

To use the form picker, a new Data Type needs to be created based on the ActiveCampaign Form Picker property editor.

The settings in `appsettings.json` will be used for sending the required HTTP header for authorization, and for retrieving the account name used for rendering the form.

## Front-end rendering

A strongly typed model will be generated by the property value converter. An HTML helper is available, to render the form on the front end.

Ensure that your template has a reference to the following using statement:

```csharp
@using Umbraco.Cms.Integrations.Crm.ActiveCampaign.Helpers;
```

Assuming a property based on the created Data Type with the alias `activeCampaignForm` has been created, render the form using:

```csharp
@Html.RenderActiveCampaignForm(Model.ActiveCampaignForm)
```
