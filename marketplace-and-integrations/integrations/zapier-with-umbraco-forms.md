# Zapier with Umbraco Forms

This integration is an add-on to the [Zapier CMS](zapier.md) integration, and provides necessary components for handling form submissions based on the registered subscription hooks.

A **Zap** is an automated workflow that connects apps and services together. Each Zap consists of a trigger and one or more actions.

## Package Links

- [NuGet install](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Forms.Integrations.Automation.Zapier)
- [Source code](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Forms.Integrations/tree/main/src/Umbraco.Forms.Integrations.Automation.Zapier)
- [Umbraco marketplace listing](https://marketplace.umbraco.com/package/umbraco.forms.integrations.automation.zapier)

## Prerequisites

Requires minimum versions:

- Umbraco CMS v8: 8.1.0
- Umbraco CMS v10+: 10.1.0
- Umbraco Forms v8: 8.9.1
- Umbraco Forms v10+: 10.1.0

## Authentication

For this integration, the authentication is managed on Zapier's side by using the Umbraco Marketplace app.

The Umbraco app manages two types of events:

- New Form Submission - triggers when a form is submitted.
- New Content Published - triggers when a new content has been published.

The trigger event to be used by this integration is _New Form Submission_.

When creating the Zap trigger, you will be prompted to enter a username, password and the URL for your Umbraco website.

It is also possible to use an API key. If the following setting is present, the API key based authentication will take precedence and will be used for authorization.

For Umbraco 8:
```xml
<appSettings>
...
  <add key="Umbraco.Forms.Integrations.Automation.Zapier.ApiKey" value="[your_api_key]" />
...
</appSettings>
```

For Umbraco 10:

```json
"Umbraco": {
  "Forms": {
    "Integrations": {
      "Automation": {
        "Zapier": {
          "Settings": {
            "ApiKey": "[your_api_key]"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If no API key is present, the Umbraco application will validate the credentials entered and return a message in case the validation fails.

To enhance security, you can specify a User Group that the user connecting needs to be a part of, by adding the following setting to `web.config`/`appsettings.json`:

For Umbraco 8:
```
<appSettings>
...
  <add key="Umbraco.Forms.Integrations.Automation.Zapier.UserGroup" value="[your_user_group]" />
...
</appSettings>
```

For Umbraco 10:

```json
"Umbraco": {
  "Forms": {
    "Integrations": {
      "Automation": {
        "Zapier": {
          "Settings": {
            "UserGroup": "[your_user_group]"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```
