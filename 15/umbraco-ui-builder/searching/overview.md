# Add Search to Your Collections

Umbraco UI Builder includes a search API for filtering and locating specific entities within a collection. This enhances usability, especially in collections with large datasets.

This section shows you how to configure search functionality within your collections.

{% content-ref url="searchable-properties.md" %}
[searchable-properties.md](searchable-properties.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
