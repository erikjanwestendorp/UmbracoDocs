7. Fill in the fields in the Order Refund modal:
    - **Order Lines section** (*only available if partial refunds are enabled*): Enter the quantity you want to refund from each order line.
    - **Restock Products toggle**: This is a flag that tells Umbraco Commerce to restock the refunded products.
    - **Refund Amount textbox**: Displays the amount that will be refunded. Its value is auto-populated, but you can enter any positive number smaller than the refundable amount.
    - **Refund button**: Clicking on this button will issue a refund with the **Refund Amount** above.
    - **Refund All button**: Clicking on this button will issue a refund for the remaining refundable amount of the order.
