# Create a new version of an article

The documentation is versioned using directories in the root of the repository. The **major** Umbraco CMS version number is used to name the directories, and you will find documentation for each versioned Umbraco product within them.

{% hint style="info" %}
The documentation follows the Long Term Support (LTS) strategy for Umbraco CMS. This means that whenever a major version is End of Life (EOL), documentation for that version will be moved to GitHub.

Read the [Documentation and versions](../documentation-and-versions.md) article to learn more about how to handle documentation for the different versions.
{% endhint %}

In order to create a new version of an article, follow these steps:

1. Access the UmbracoDocs GitHub repository.
2. Fork the repository.
3. Clone your fork to your local machine.

{% hint style="info" %}
It is also possible to make changes and submit PRs directly through GitHub. This is sometimes easier when the change you're suggesting is minor.
{% endhint %}

4. Grab a copy of the existing article you are looking to update.
5. Add the copy to the directory for the version you're updating the article for.
6. Make the changes.
7. Commit and push the updates to GitHub.
8. Submit a PR to the original UmbracoDocs repository.
