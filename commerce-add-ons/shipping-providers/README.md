# What are Shipping Providers?

Shipping providers are essential for your Umbraco Commerce installation when you want to give users and customers options for how they wish to ship products.

The Basic option comes with Umbraco Commerce out of the box. Integrations for different providers are available for you to add additional shipping options to your site.
