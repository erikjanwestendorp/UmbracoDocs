## Step 2: API Keys

In order for Umbraco Commerce to communicate with Shipmondo securely we need to retrieve a series of API keys used for authentication.

1. Access the Shipmondo Portal.
2. Choose the Settings > API > Access menu item.

Here you will find your API Username and key. Note these down as you will need to enter them into the Umbraco Commerce UI shortly.
