# Installation

The Product Feeds package can be installed directly into your project's code base using NuGet packages.

## Getting started

Below you can find some steps on installing the package using NuGet and getting started with implementing the Product Feeds into your Umbraco Commerce store.

1. Install the package from [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Umbraco.Commerce.ProductFeeds/)
2.  Locate where you [register the dependencies](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-commerce/key-concepts/umbraco-commerce-builder#registering-dependencies) `IUmbracoBuilder.AddUmbracoCommerce()` and add a call to `IUmbracoCommerceBuilder.AddCommerceProductFeeds()` to add this plugin to your website.

    ```csharp
     umbracoBuilder.AddUmbracoCommerce(ucBuilder => {
         ucBuilder.AddCommerceProductFeeds(); // add this line
     }
    ```
3. Open your store's setting page in the backoffice.
4. Click on `Product Feed` section.

### Upgrading

{% hint style="info" %}
Even though the package modifies only the `umbracoCommerceProductFeedSetting` table, it is always advisable to take a complete backup of your site/database before upgrading.
{% endhint %}

The Product Feeds package uses a database migration for both installs and upgrades. Upgrading is generally a case of installing the latest version via NuGet over the existing package and restarting the website.
