#### Breaking changes since preview001

The new preview is running .NET 8 Preview 6 which may contain breaking changes on custom code.

Due to the nature of extension conditions, your custom extensions may no longer show up in the Backoffice until you migrate to conditions. You can read more about the[ changes in conditions on the Backoffice Library](https://apidocs.umbraco.com/v14/ui/?path=/docs/guides-extending-the-backoffice-registration-conditions--docs).

## Upcoming features

Some features are not complete yet but will land in upcoming alpha releases:

* Publish documents
* Server validation of data
* User permissions

## Caveats

### .NET

The Alpha version range ships with the latest preview release of .NET 8, which passes in our internal test suite. However some limitations may be imposed in the Software Development Kit (SDK) itself. [Read more on dot.net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).

### Website frontend

It will not be possible to build a complete end-to-end website using this prerelease version of Umbraco. You can expect to be able to build a website once the Release Candidate is available.
