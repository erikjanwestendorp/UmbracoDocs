# Getting Started With The New Backoffice

### Overview

The new Backoffice of Umbraco is currently targeting version 14 of Umbraco, which is expected to be released in May 2024.

There are a few ways to check out the new Backoffice, while it is being developed. This may interest you if you are an extension or a package developer looking to get an early headstart to upgrade your extensions.

Read on to get an overview of the different ways in which you can check up on the development of the Backoffice.

### Download the prerelease of Umbraco 14

We will release a prebuilt version of Umbraco during the development phase of the new Backoffice. This happens as we see fit and will be [introduced on our blog](https://umbraco.com/blog).

There are a few caveats to working with the prerelease of Umbraco 14. [You can read much more about the prereleases here](alpha-release.md).

You can also skip directly to the article [Installing Preview Builds](../../fundamentals/setup/installation/installing-preview-builds.md) to learn more about how to work with the prelease.

### Building from source

If you want to live on the bleeding edge and follow the latest development, you should check out [our public GitHub repository](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.CMS.Backoffice). This article will explain in more detail how to build and run the new Backoffice on its own or target an Umbraco instance.
