{% endhint %}

### Available features and functionality

## Caveats

### .NET

The Alpha version range ships with the latest preview release of .NET 8, which passes in our internal test suite, but some limitations may be imposed in the SDK itself. [Read more on dot.net](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/8.0).

### Website frontend

It will not be possible to build a complete end-to-end website using this alpha version of Umbraco. You can expect to be able to build a website using the Release Candidate of Umbraco CMS.
