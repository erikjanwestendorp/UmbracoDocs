  We introduced the idea of Requests for Comments (RFCs) as a way for the
  Backoffice of Umbraco to remain relevant and keep up with the awesome
  updates/changes to the software.

# Request for Comments

As Umbraco is used in a wide variety of ways. We want to make the backoffice as easy, safe, and simple as possible for anyone to create and add packages to.

The RFC process is intended to provide a consistent way for Umbraco HQ to facilitate the transparency of decisions made for features and changes in Umbraco products

If you've not come across the concept of RFCs before then you might want to check out the [UmbraCoffee episode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0QfgRYj0zQ\&t=1681s) where RFCs were introduced and explained.

The process outline:

* An RFC [pull request is made](https://github.com/umbraco/rfcs/blob/main/RFC\_CREATION.md) by Umbraco HQ and is thereby [open for comments](https://github.com/umbraco/rfcs/blob/main/RFC\_PROCESS.md#Reviewing).
* The RFC may be [updated, closed, or restarted if necessary](https://github.com/umbraco/rfcs/blob/main/RFC\_PROCESS.md#Updating) by the Author if they choose to.
* When Umbraco HQ decides to finalize the RFC, it will be tagged for final comments and a deadline will be provided.
* At the provided deadline the [RFC will be accepted or closed](https://github.com/umbraco/rfcs/blob/main/RFC\_PROCESS.md#Acceptance) by Umbraco HQ.
* The [implementation](https://github.com/umbraco/rfcs/blob/main/RFC\_PROCESS.md#Implementation) may begin.

## RFCs for the Umbraco Backoffice

Below is a handful of links to the RFCs related to the new Umbraco backoffice. If you want to learn more about why certain decisions were made, the RFCs are the best resource.
