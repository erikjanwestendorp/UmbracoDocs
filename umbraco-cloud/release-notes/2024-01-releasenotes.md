## Self-Service Cipher Suite Management 
In our ongoing effort to enhance your experience with Umbraco Cloud, we've introduced a new feature that puts the power of cipher suite management at your fingertips. Now available as a self-service option in the Cloud Portal's “Security Page”, this update lets you enable or disable cipher suites directly through a user-friendly "Ciphers" dropdown menu.

We understand that managing security settings is a critical aspect of any cloud project, and our goal is to make this process as seamless as possible. With this latest update, you have the flexibility to tailor security settings to your specific needs, whether it's for an individual project or across multiple hostnames. By default, we've kept all cipher suites enabled, ensuring that you start with robust security measures in place
