# Subscription migration information and FAQ

The migration of Umbraco Cloud subscriptions from shop.umbraco.com to the new subscription and billing engine on Umbraco Cloud will start on September 4, 2023. The migration will be performed in batches in close collaboration with our payment provider to ensure the subscriptions are moved correctly.&#x20;

The process will be handled automatically, no action is required on your end.&#x20;

You can find documentation on how the new subscription and billing engine works in the [Organizations documentation](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cloud/getting-started/the-umbraco-cloud-portal/organizations) and [Payments documentation](https://docs.umbraco.com/umbraco-cloud/set-up/manage-subscriptions/new-shop).

### Frequently Asked Questions

#### What is the difference between “the old shop” and the new subscription and billing engine?

#### What should I be aware of when a subscription is migrated?

* The subscription will be connected to an organization on Umbraco Cloud.
* You will only be charged once a month and can find information about invoices and credit cards under your organization.
