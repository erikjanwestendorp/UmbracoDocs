# Creating a Cloud Project

Starting your journey with Umbraco Cloud begins with creating your first project. A streamlined process designed to get you up and running quickly with all the power of Umbraco and the cloud, without complex setup.

You can either create a [trial project](./#umbraco-cloud-trialproject) or a project from the [Umbraco Cloud Portal](./#creating-a-project-from-the-umbraco-cloud-portal).

## Umbraco Cloud Trial Project

The easiest way to start with an Umbraco Cloud project is to take a [14-day free trial](https://try.umbraco.com/cloud). The project is automatically created, and you are ready to start within a few minutes.

Since everything is already set up for you, it is recommended that you get to know your project before you start building.

You can either work directly in the backoffice on the Cloud environment or [clone down the project to your local machine](../../build-and-customize-your-solution/handle-deployments-and-environments/working-locally/).

### Naming a Project

When you create a Trial project a unique project name will be generated for you.

When you create a new Project from the Umbraco Cloud Portal you must give the project a name.

All project names are unique.

### Project Overview

Once a project is created, you can get an overview of it from the Umbraco Cloud Portal:

1. Log in to the [Umbraco Cloud Portal](https://www.s1.umbraco.io/projects).
2. Select your Project from the **Projects** dashboard.
3. Click on **Overview** from the left side menu.

The **Overview** menu consists of:

* A place to manage the [**Environments**](../../build-and-customize-your-solution/handle-deployments-and-environments/manage-environments.md) on your project.
* A place to manage the [**Team**](../project-features/team-members/) that has access to your project.
* A page that gives a **Summary** of your project, like when it was created, that plan, and more.

## Different ways to start an Umbraco Cloud project

Not every project starts from scratch. Depending on your needs, there are other ways to kick-start your Cloud journey:

{% content-ref url="migrate-to-umbraco-cloud.md" %}
[migrate-to-umbraco-cloud.md](migrate-to-umbraco-cloud.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="baselines.md" %}
[baselines.md](baselines.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}
