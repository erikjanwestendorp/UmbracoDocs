# Organizations

On Umbraco Cloud, you can get an Umbraco Cloud Organization. With an Organization, you get an overview of all the projects that have been created by you and the members of your Organization.

If you are interested in getting an Organization, please reach out to our Support Team through the Chat box in your project overview.

## Managing your Organization

In the following sections, we will go through the different options that are available in an Organization:

### Members

In the **Members** section, you can get an overview, view pending invites, and the Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) for the Members of your Organization. It is also possible to set up different permissions for your Members, such as Read, Write, and Administrators for your organization.

### MFA enforcement

When working in organizations on Umbraco Cloud, as a company, you might want to enforce a certain type of MFA for members.

Administrators of Organizations on Umbraco Cloud can enforce MFA for specific members of their organization.

To enforce a certain MFA for a member, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Organizations** tab under your user on Umbraco Cloud.
2. Go to the **Members** tab under Organization.
3. Go to **Multi-Factor Authentication**.
4. Find the member that needs to have MFA enabled.
5. Click on the cogwheel and select the **Enforced MFA Method** from the drop-down list for the member.

Once it has been enabled, the next time the member logs in, they will be enforced to set up the MFA that has been chosen.
It is possible for an administrator to reset the authenticator app settings for members of the organization.

### Projects

In the **Projects** section, you can get an overview of all the Projects that have been created in your Organization.
