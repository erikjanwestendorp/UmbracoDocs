# Partial Views

A Partial View (`.cshtml` file) is a regular view that can be used multiple times throughout your site. A Partial View is used to break up large markup files into smaller components such as header, footer, navigation menu etc. It helps to reduce the duplication of code. A partial view renders a view within the parent view.

## Partial Views in the Backoffice

You can create and edit partial views in the **Partial Views** folder from the **Settings** section of the Backoffice.

In the **Create** menu, there are three options available:

* New empty partial view
* New partial view from snippet
* Folder (for keeping the partial views organized)

## Creating a Partial View

To create a partial view, go to the **Settings** section in the Umbraco backoffice and right-click the **Partial Views** folder. Choose **Create**. Select **New empty partial view** and enter a partial view name and click the **Save** button. You will now see the partial view markup in the backoffice editor.

By default, the partial view is saved in the `Views/Partials` folder in the solution.

## Creating a Partial View from Snippet

To create a partial view from the snippet, go to the **Settings** section in the Umbraco backoffice and right-click the **Partial Views** folder. Choose **Create**. Select **New empty partial view from snippet**. Select the snippet you want to create a partial view for and enter a partial view name. The code snippet you selected is displayed in the backoffice editor. Click the **Save** button.

## Rendering a Partial View

To render the created partial view into any template, use any of these helper methods: `@Html.PartialAsync`, `@Html.Partial()`, or `@Html.RenderPartial()`

```csharp
@using Umbraco.Cms.Web.Common.PublishedModels;
@inherits Umbraco.Cms.Web.Common.Views.UmbracoViewPage<ContentModels.HomePage>
@using ContentModels = Umbraco.Cms.Web.Common.PublishedModels;
@{
	Layout = null;
}

@await Html.PartialAsync("Login")

@Html.Partial("Login")

@{
 Html.RenderPartial("Login");   
}
```
