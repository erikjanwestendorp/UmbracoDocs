# Contributing to Hacktoberfest

We [have general contribution guidelines available](../README.md) for Umbraco-CMS, the backoffice project, the UI library and documentation. 

Specificially for Hacktoberfest, we have a lot more things you can get involved in!

## Packages

Packages are back on the menu - and yes, they also count as a contribution to Umbraco!

Here are some specific details on this:

* Only contributions made to open-source Umbraco packages added to the Hacktoberfest Package repo list counts
* Follow the contribution guidelines provided by the package creator
* Look for the "help wanted" label on the issue tracker associated with the package you want to help out with
* Read much more about how this works, and guidelines on adding your own package repo to [the list on the Umbraco Packages Hacktoberfest homepage](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Packages/tree/main/Hacktoberfest). 

Please note: Package contributions eligibility for swag  differ slightly from those used for all contributions. Read more on the **[Packages Hacktoberfest guidelines](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Packages/tree/main/Hacktoberfest) to learn more about how a contribution is marked as "swag-eligible"**.

### Creating a brand-new package

Publishing a brand new package to [the Umbraco Marketplace](https://marketplace.umbraco.com/) will also count towards both DigitalOcean's and Umbraco's Hacktoberfest contributions ‚≠êü§©

Packages for Umbraco 14 and up are eligible by default, even if the equivalent package already exists for older Umbraco versions.

## Low-code / no-code contributions 

Back, by popular demand, we will also be rewarding contributions that are either low-code and more importantly: no-code!

Eligible contributions according to [the Hacktoberfest guidelines](https://hacktoberfest.com/about/#low-or-non-code) include:

* Verifying documentation
* Copy editing
* User experience testing
* Talks or presentations
* Blog posts
* Podcasts
* Case studies
* Organizing Hacktoberfest events

We [have set up a special GitHub repository](https://github.com/umbraco/HacktoberfestActivityLog) for you to record your contributions that are not a pull request.

In order to record your journey of verifying documentation (like related blog post(s) in October, events organized), please edit the README.md file and add your activity at the end in the recommended format and submit that as a pull request. We‚Äôll take it from there!

## Sponsor an Umbraco-related GitHub repository

To appreciate people who maintain open-source projects for the Umbraco ecosystem, an easy way to help contribute is to give them some money! We‚Äôd suggest you have a look at your favorite packages and see if their repo/maintainer is accepting sponsorship. 

We suggest you scroll through the [list of topics on GitHub, filtered by Umbraco](https://github.com/topics/umbraco), and see if your favorite packages/authors are open to sponsorship. Look for the heart icon.

If you're in doubt if your chosen sponsorship would count, then feel free to first [create an issue on the Hacktoberfest Activity Log repository](https://github.com/umbraco/HacktoberfestActivityLog/issues), or ask [on Discord](https://discord.umbraco.com/) in the #contributing channel.

Umbraco HQ [sponsors 4 different projects at the moment](https://community.umbraco.com/the-community-blog/oss-sponsorship-initiative/), at $100 per month. These are excellent projects that could always use more sponsorships, but make sure to also consider other repositories, there are many great ones out there!

And the good news is: yes, you will be able to earn Umbraco swag, proportionate to your sponsorship amount. 

## How we judge a Hacktoberfest-eligible contribution

We use [the Hacktoberfest participation rules](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/) to qualify, so any contributions that do not follow these standards will also not count towards Umbraco swag. These rules are to ensure we get quality contributions and that the right efforts get rewarded üôå

If you‚Äôre contributing to one of the open-source Umbraco Packages, please check [the Packages Hacktoberfest guidelines](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Packages/tree/main/Hacktoberfest) to learn more about how a contribution is marked as "swag-eligible".

## Any questions?

In order to help you succeed we at HQ are trying to be available as much as possible during the month of October on Discord in the [#contributing](https://discord-chats.umbraco.com/c/contributing) channel.

Whether you need some inspiration, guidance, help getting things to build, and so on - we‚Äôre there to support and guide you, together with the [Core Collaborators team](https://community.umbraco.com/community-teams/the-core-collaborators/).
